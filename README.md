## Object Oriented Paradigm:

- There are four principles of the object-oriented paradigm, and these principles are:

 - **Abstraction**.
 - **Encapsulation**.
 - **Inheritance**.
 - **Polymorphism**.


### Abstraction:

- Abstraction helps to create a simplified but relevant view of a real-world object within the context of the problem and the solution.

### Encapsulation:

- Encapsulation is an essential property of an object. It's a mechanism by which some information of an object is hidden, determining how the information of an object can be modified or used.

### Inheritance:

- Inheritance defines relationships among classes, and a subclass object is represented as a kind of superclass object. It is important to mention that in **Java**, every class created descends from __java.lang.Object__ and implements its methods.

### Polymorphism:
- Polymorphism is a concept where a variable of declared type T can be assigned different types of objects at runtime, provided they are subtypes of the variable's type T.

## Java:

### Definition:
- Java is an object-oriented programming language similar to C and C++, which is platform-independent, meaning that it can be **run anywhere** (__"write once, run everywhere"__).

### How it works?
- Contrary to its counterpart **C**, **Java** can run everywhere. So, if we compile a C program on a certain OS, it can only be executed on that specific OS. In contrast, Java can be compiled by the executable __**javac**__ into a __.class__ file format, that is a bytecode file, which can then be run on any platform by the **JVM**.

### What are classes?
- A class is a blueprint for creating or instantiating objects. It contains attributes (information) and methods (algorithms) which are characteristics of those objects.
**N.B**: Java code is always structured and written inside classes.
